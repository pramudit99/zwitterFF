*zwitterFF* is an OPLS based force field for molecular dynamics simulations of zwitterions and their polymers.
It coarse grains most alkane hydrogen atom and employes virtual cites and lincs algorithms to represent stiff parts of the molecules.
This accelerates simulations to access time scales to equilibrate slow charged polymers, i.e. poly-zwitterions,
without sacrificing much chemical resolution.
